# UnSivilized
Travel Blog -- First full stack app.

Nov 9, 2023

This was an interesting expierience. This app is obviously pretty simple, but it certainly helped me learn a ton!
It was made for my Wife (client).

Processes that were fairly easy => 
        Basic Routing / Express is pretty beginner friendly, and I quite enjoyed it. 
        displaying data in html through ejs, 
        Mongoose/MongoDB, 
        and bootstrap.

Processes that were dificult but I was able to figure out with time => 
        Â¡MULTER! and File handling (took me a Week, it ended up being an issue in app.js with the app.use("/uploads") + lack of knowledge,
        Editing posts w/ put method (I still need to learn how to handle multi-part/formData editing),
        Query and routing Params,
        Trying to figure out proper folder and file structure was nausiating. So many options, and it still may be wrong... ,

Processes that I ended up having to copy code from video tutorial =>
        Auth with JWT via login and register. 
        Hidden routes by Auth

Final touches that need to be made =>
        Finilize about page,
        Make final decisions on colors and font,
        region specific banners.

My General thoughts =>
        The project took way longer than I thought it would! What I figured might take 4 - 6 weeks ended up taking 2 1/2 months.
        I really enjoyed this project and the general programming experience itself. After a while the broken code and issues became a game,
not solving the problem is generally not acceptable as the app wouldn't work, so you fix it and move on to the next issue.
        I can't wait to start up my next project and continue learning programming concepts.

Next up => 
        Become more comfertable with JWT, AUTH, and file uploads, deletes and edits.
        Re-write this app in either asp.net with react or next.js, and use a relational DB instead of MongoDB.
